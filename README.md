# Window Input - File Upload Button

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that creates a custom **file upload button**.  
Instead of using the default file input style, the project hides the native file input and replaces it with a styled button. When a file is selected, the button text updates to display the selected file’s name.
